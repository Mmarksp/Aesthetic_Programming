In this README I present my very first program currently and indefinitely titled "mini_ex".</br></br>

And so the coding is done for this exercise.
My program was inspired by the code for "textures" as found in the p5.js reference web-page. By using the reference as a baseline, I was able to experiment with the coding in order to seek out new insights.

In one example, I experienced how removing *background()* led to, what I believe are, several layers of the same image being placed in a slightly different spot every time the rotate commands were run through. This leads me to a revelation that perhaps no images are actually deleted from the browser-page every time the draw() commands are run through (which I would otherwise assume), and that perhaps having a *background()* makes it seem that way, because it becomes an obscuring layer on top of the previous images.</br>

I also tried experimenting with implementation of .gif as texture. However, that led me nowhere. I even expanded my p5 library with a gif extension, but while it could then properly run my program, all gif textures were replaced with a black colour. Perhaps the textures could just not load for some reason. At any rate, I could not find the answers through the console window in the browser.</br>

I finally settled with two shapes rotating in a 3D-canvas. I used my own picture for the box and found a suitable picture of an eye on the internet (most pictures became too stretched around an ellipse shape). I tried several pictures in several configurations, but with the same motive - rotation within a bigger box.

I think it was a really good idea prior to the course, that I invested some time with HTML and CSS. I was definitely more familiar with certain elements of the syntax, which made it so much easier to grasp what I was doing with p5 in the text editor. If there were elements of syntax I did not understand, I would then experiment and observe, or look it up online. Obviously, what I have been doing so far has also been quite simple. Nevertheless, there is a certain grammar to this, and to be familiar with some fundamentals makes it easier to then attempt testing how other commands would work or wouldn't work in combination with one another.</br>

Writing code, experiencing this very specific syntax and being able to see its immediate effect has been very rewarding. The logic of the language initially seems to me an extension of writing and reading in order to easier facilitate human interaction. The text editors are designed to be used by humans, and writing code is still based on established systems of letters and numbers found on keyboards. However, code has its own logic in order to work, and it certainly shows different results than reading and writing. I expect to be challenged over the next few weeks in how coding is able to distance itself from anything I am familiar with.

Coding has been compared to a literacy, especially given where the world is heading. Technology is increasingly proliferated, coding surrounds us in our devices and impacts our lives in many different ways.
I cannot say whether or not coding is a literacy. Even the word literacy is to be regarded with skepticism, as it is often used alongside an agenda for change. However, it is also unclear for me, where coding can take us and what actually constitutes coding. So far I have managed to create a rotating eye in a canvas, but so much of my life outside of University revolves around coding everyday, and I do not, as of yet, understand coding. Not even taking a jobless future into account, this is motivation enough to make me want to understand and acquire the skills of programming.
